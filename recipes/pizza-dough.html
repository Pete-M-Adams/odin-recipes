    <h1> Today we're gonna learn about baking percentages!!!</h1>
    <p> Every single person on earth has the ability to learn how to make pizza dough, however, 
    understanding baking percentages will not just prepare you to make exceptional pizza but your 
    baking skills will increase exponentially if you master this simple algorithm. Weirdly enough, 
    determining and adjusting baking percentages will help you solve problems more like a programmer as well. 
    This is basically foccacia for dorks. To start, you need some ingredients...
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li> flour (AP or bread flour both work)</li>
        <li> warm water (100-120 ish degrees F)</li>
        <li> granulated white sugar </li>
        <li> course kosher salt </li>
        <li> NICE olive oil, the best shit you can find</li>
        <li> dry active yeast that is NOT dead (you can test it by blooming a small ammount of it in a small bit of warm water and a pinch of sugar, no need to be too precise. wait like 6-7 mins if it bubbles it is alive) </li>
     </ul>
     <h1> You're gonna need some tools too</h1>
     <ul>
        <li> a medium sized mixing bowl (needs to be close to 4 quarts volume)</li>
        <li> a silicone tip spatula </li>
        <li> a kitchen scale that measures grams (you cannot make this recipe without one)</li>
        <li> a stand mixer (if the lord permits)</li>
        <li> plastic wrap that's wide enough to completely cover the opening of your bowl</li>
        <li> a kitchen towel </li>
        <li> an oven safe metal 1/2 pan sized baking sheet</li>
        <li> a liquid-holding vessel that is safe for temps above 100f</li>
        <li> your grubby little hands</li>
     </ul>
     <h3> Now, lets get started</h3>
     <p> First thing's first, lets determine our baking percentages. Planning is the most important part of any time-sensisive recipe. If you don't have all of your ingredients measured and prepared before you even start the process, you will be more likely to make mistakes. Chefs call this "mise en place" which coloquially means "everything in its place". There are some principles that need to be followed throughout this recipe, the concept of mise en place covers all those principles. If you want to learn a bit more about best practices in the kitchen <a href="https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/what-is-mise-en-place-and-why-is-it-so-important-to-chefs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click this.</a></p>
     <h3> Understanding Baking Percentages</h3>
     <p> To find your baking percetages for a particular recipe- take the mass of the highest volume ingredient in your recipe, weigh that on a scale in grams, and work backwards to determine what percentage of the other ingredients in your recipe fit into that whole </p>
     <p> Bear with me here, let's say you have 500g of flour. That would mean that you need 300g of warm water, 15g of salt, 5g of yeast, 20g of olive oil, and 5g of sugar. If you work backwards, you can determine that the baker's percentages of each ingredient (keeping in mind that the amount of flour you have represents 100%) are- water= (flour *.6), salt= (flour * .03), yeast= (flour * .01), olive oil= (flour * .04), and sugar = (flour * .01). If you are interested in programming, I highly recomend that you use this formula to build a script in python and test your recipe against it! <a href="pythoncode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's a bit of python3 code that you can copy and paste into any editor youre using!</a> Just input the amount of flour you have after running the code in your terminal and it'll spit out your measurements for you easy peasy. </p>
     <h3> Now that we got that out of the way, we can actually start cooking</h3>
     <p> SIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Were gotta do more math!!!!! The cool thing is the algorithm is already finished for us, so all you have to do is plug and play. Follow all these steps and you'll be ready to send it.</p>
     <ol>
      <li> measure your flour (you can use any amount, but 500g is the intended quantity to most accurately fit the pan that you need. You can always scale up and down) </li>
      <li> use the formula we came up with earlier to measure out the rest of your ingredients. Combine all dry ingredients (discluding oil for the time being) in the mixing bowl. You can combine all the "wet" ingredients in the liquid-holding vessel we talked about earlier. Wet ingredients in this recipe include sugar, yeast, and water. This does not include oil. Don't ask me why sugar and yeast are considered "wet" ingredients, bakers are weird with the way they categorize things. </li>
      <li> let the yeast bloom for 10 minutes or until your solution gets a little bubbly and foamy </li>
      <li> combine all the ingredients in the mixing bowl (yes now you can put the oil in) and mix with your spatula until the dough is just past shaggy texture and all the ingredients are homogenous. If you have a stand mixer, run it on a low speed with a dough hook and stop mixing when the dough starts to stick to the hook and bounce around the bowl. </li>
      <li> once your dough has reached its desired texture, cover your bowl with plastic wrap and place your kitchen towel on top of the bowl to prepare for the peek-a-boo game youre going to play with the dough in an hour</li>
      <li> wait an hour, uncover dough and fold each side of it inside itself (i know it's a spehere, but try to think of the dough as if its a cube)</li>
      <li> repeat step 6 one more time</li>
      <li> cover your dough super tight and toss it in the fridge until its ready to be used (let it sit at least for 12-24 hours tho)</li>
      <li> pull your dough out of the fridge and uncover it- wow!! it's huge now!!!!!</li>
      <li> leave your dough out of the fridge undisturbed for a bit so it can start to warm up</li>
      <li> while your dough is coming up to temp </li>
      <li> spread some olive oil out on the sheet pan, and when your dough has sat for a sufficient period of time, transfer it to your pan and let it rest</li>
      <li> periodically push your dough into the corners of the pan and let it rise, once your dough fits the pan youre good to top and bake!!!</li>
   </ol>
