    <h1> Today we're gonna learn about baking percentages!!!</h1>
    <p> Every single person on earth has the ability to learn how to make pizza dough, however, 
    understanding baking percentages will not just prepare you to make exceptional pizza but your 
    baking skills will increase exponentially if you master this simple algorithm. Weirdly enough, 
    determining and adjusting baking percentages will help you solve problems more like a programmer as well. 
    This is basically foccacia for dorks. To start, you need some ingredients...
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li> flour (AP or bread flour both work)</li>
        <li> warm water (100-120 ish degrees F)</li>
        <li> granulated white sugar </li>
        <li> course kosher salt </li>
        <li> NICE olive oil, the best shit you can find</li>
        <li> dry active yeast that is NOT dead (you can test it by blooming a small ammount of it in a small bit of warm water and a pinch of sugar, no need to be too precise. wait like 6-7 mins if it bubbles it is alive) </li>
     </ul>
     <h1> You're gonna need some tools too</h1>
     <ul>
        <li> a medium sized mixing bowl (needs to be close to 4 quarts volume)</li>
        <li> a silicone tip spatula </li>
        <li> a kitchen scale that measures grams (you cannot make this recipe without one)</li>
        <li> a stand mixer (if the lord permits)</li>
        <li> plastic wrap that's wide enough to completely cover the opening of your bowl</li>
        <li> a kitchen towel </li>
        <li> your grubby little hands</li>
     </ul>
     <h3> Now, lets get started</h3>
     <p> First thing's first, lets determine our baking percentages. Planning is the most important part of any time-sensisive recipe. If you don't have all of your ingredients measured and prepared before you even start the process, you will be more likely to make mistakes. Chefs call this "mise en place" which coloquially means "everything in its place". There are some principles that need to be followed throughout this recipe, the concept of mise en place covers all those principles. If you want to learn a bit more about best practices in the kitchen <a href="https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/what-is-mise-en-place-and-why-is-it-so-important-to-chefs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click this.</a></p>
     <h3> Understanding Baking Percentages</h3>
     <p> To find your baking percetages for a particular recipe- take the mass of the highest volume ingredient in your recipe, weigh that on a scale in grams, and work backwards to determine what percentage of the other ingredients in your recipe fit into that whole </p>
     <p> Bear with me here, let's say you have 500g of flour. That would mean that you need 300g of warm water, 15g of salt, 5g of yeast, 20g of olive oil, and 5g of sugar. If you work backwards, you can determine that the baker's percentages of each ingredient (keeping in mind that the amount of flour you have represents 100%) are- water= (flour *.6), salt= (flour * .03), yeast= (flour * .01), olive oil= (flour * .04), and sugar = (flour * .01). If you are interested in programming, I highly recomend that you use this formula to build a script in python and test your recipe against it! <a href="pythoncode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's a bit of python3 code that you can copy and paste into any editor youre using!</a> Just input the amount of flour you have after running the code in your terminal and it'll spit out your measurements for you easy peasy. </p>
